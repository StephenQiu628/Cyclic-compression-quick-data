# Cyclic-compression-quick-data

Designed for cyclic compression tests, especially those with many cycles.

You need to change some parts to suit your input files. 

You will see a sample input file "Specimen_RawData_1" in this project.

Your input should include "strain" column, "stress" column and the number of the cycle.

If you got any problems, requests for help will always be welcomed.
